This is a python utility that grabs data from Picasa and converts it into CSV format.

Pre-requirements
----------------
Needs Python 2.6+ (this should be built-in on MacOS)

Download
----------
Download the picasaparser.py script and put it in some folder.

You can just go to 
  https://github.com/shamiksharma/picasa_csv/raw/master/picasaparse.py
and copy paste the content into a file called picasaparse.py

OR

open a terminal
% cd   your-preferred-folder
% curl 'https://github.com/shamiksharma/picasa_csv/raw/master/picasaparse.py' -o picasaparse.py


Usage (from terminal) :
-----------------------
% python picasaparse.py  your-picasa-api-url  >  your-csv-file-name.csv

Example: 
% python picasaparse.py 'https://picasaweb.google.com/data/feed/api/all?kind=photo' > mydatafile.csv



Spreadsheet:
-------------

You can then load mydatafile.csv into a spreadsheet and analyse it.

The first line of the CSV file is a "column-header" line which 
describes the columns. Excel and other spreadsheets allow you to
specify that the first line should be treated as a header when importing.

Note that some rows of the input might not be correctly aligned (due to
special characters in the input etc). You should eyeball the data and
remove any such rows from the spreadsheet.
