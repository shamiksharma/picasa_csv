This is a python utility that grabs data from Picasa and converts it into CSV format.

Pre-requirements
----------------
Needs Python 2.6+ (this should be built-in on MacOS)

Usage (from terminal) :
-----------------------
% python picasaparse.py  your-picasa-api-url  >  your-csv-file-name.csv

Example: 
-------------
% python picasaparse.py "https://picasaweb.google.com/data/feed/api/all?kind=photo" > mydatafile.csv

Spreadsheet:
-------------
You can then load mydatafile.csv into a spreadsheet and analyse it.
The first line of the CSV file is a "column-header" line which 
describes the columns. Excel and other spreadsheets allow you to
specify that the first line should be treated as a header when importing.
